# SFMLUI

UI Renderer for .Net based on SFML

Here is my UI renderer for my old game project. The UI system is based on the SFML.Net wrapper (https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net) by Laurent Gomila.

The library contains the following features:
- Primitive render elements : rectangles, circles, lines, graphics, sprites, text
- Element templates to customize controls.
- Scenes, controls and container for control-groups
- Property binding ( similar to DepedencyProperties )
- Animation-System: color, moving and rotation.
- Style-system definition in XML ( not finished )
- Event-System incl. MouseOver, MouseLeave and double-click.

Many functions are not yet fully implemented:
- Time-controlled animations ( Storyboard ).
- Styles to assign control elements quickly and easily to designs.
- Templates for controls
- XML definition of animations, styles and templates not yet fully implemented
